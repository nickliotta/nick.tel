# Interesting History
Posted on January 2, 2026

I often encounter historical topics on social media that I don’t know much about, which prompts me to do further research and understand the perspectives involved. Here’s a curated list of subjects I found interesting enough to explore further.

1. There is no concrete evidence that turkey was on the menu in late 1621, when the Pilgrim settlers of Plymouth Colony sat down with indigenous Wampanoag people for what we recognize today as the first Thanksgiving. A contemporary account of the event was captured by Edward Winslow, who described venison, fish, and shellfish, as well as corn and other vegetables, as being what the settlers and Native Americans dined on. Thanksgiving did not become a nationwide holiday until after the American Civil War, largely thanks to Sarah Josepha Hale, who campaigned for its creation and is also known as the author of the nursery rhyme “Mary Had a Little Lamb.”

2. The University of Paris originated around 1150 as a corporation of cathedral schools, making it the second-oldest university in Europe. It was the leading university in Paris until 1970. Following the May 1968 student uprisings in France — protesting university conditions and government repression — the university was divided into 13 independent institutions that we know of today, including Sorbonne University and Université Paris Cité.

3. Under current federal law in the United States, specifically the [Crime Control Act of 1990](https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/3266), most able-bodied inmates who are not security risks and do not have medical exemptions are required to work. Wages for prison labor typically range between $0.14 and $2.00 an hour. Federal agencies are required to prioritize purchasing prison-made goods produced by [[UNICOR|Federal Prison Industries]], including textiles and electronics. Through UNICOR, a wholly owned federal government corporation created in 1934, this program is entirely self-sustaining and operates at no direct cost to taxpayers due to its reliance on low-cost penal labor.

4. On August 19, 1953, Iran’s democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh was overthrown in a coup d’etat orchestrated by the United States (CIA) and the United Kingdom (MI6). Mosaddegh had moved to nationalize Iran’s oil industry after the British-owned [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|Predecessor BP p.l.c.]] refused to submit to Iranian oversight and continued to exercise near-total control over Iran’s oil revenues. In response, the Iranian parliament nationalized the oil industry and expelled foreign corporate representatives from the country. While the Truman administration opposed a coup, fearing the precedent it would set, the Eisenhower administration approved the operation. Following the coup, the Shah reasserted power and appointed General Fazlollah Zahedi as prime minister, relying heavily on United States and British support to consolidate authority. The coup severely damaged the United States’ credibility among Iranians and contributed to long-term resentment toward Western involvement, with the Shah’s United States-backed authoritarian monarchy remaining in power until the Iranian Revolution of 1979.

5. The Kingdom of Hawaiʻi was overthrown in a coup d’état against Queen Liliʻuokalani on January 17, 1893, by a group of American and European residents of Hawaii to protect the national interest of the United States of America. This led to the establishment of a Provisional Government, which eventually became the Republic of Hawaii. Following the election of President William McKinley in 1896 and continued lobbying by annexation advocates, Hawaii was formally annexed by the United States in 1898.

6. The [Balfour Declaration of 1917](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/balfour.asp) was a British statement supporting the creation of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire with a small Jewish population. In 1922, the [[League of Nations|Predecessor of the United Nations]] granted Britain a mandate over Palestine, creating Mandatory Palestine. Rising tensions between Jewish and Arab communities over immigration and governance led Britain to end the mandate in 1948. The United Nations proposed partitioning Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, but the plan was rejected by Arab leaders. When the mandate ended, Jewish leaders declared the independence of the State of Israel in May 1948, triggering the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

7. Hong Kong, one of China’s two special administrative regions along with Macau, was a British colony from 1841 to 1997. The colony was expanded in 1898 when Britain leased the New Territories for 99 years. The handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People’s Republic of China was completed at midnight on July 1, 1997, marking a symbolic end to the British Empire. Even today, as a special administrative region, Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy, with its own currency, HKSAR passport, residency status, and education system.

8. Jacobo Árbenz was the second democratically elected president of Guatemala. On July 17, 1952, during the Guatemalan Revolution, he passed the [Agrarian Reform Law](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000914810.pdf), which aimed to modernize Guatemala’s agrarian economy. The law redistributed unused land over 224 acres to local peasants while compensating landowners with government bonds. This expropriation affected the major landowner, the [[United Fruit Company|Predecessor of Chiquita Brands International]], which lobbied the United States to intervene by portraying the Guatemalan government as communist. Without due diligence, the Central Intelligence Agency carried out [Operation PBSuccess](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000134974.pdf) in 1954, overthrowing Árbenz and replacing him with the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas.
